# Meme_page

In order to compile it install Live Server plugin in VSCode and right click on index.html -> you should then see option 'Open with Live Server'. Click on it and the localhost should automatically open. 

In order to work and modify scss file drop the command line below to console: 
```
sass --watch style.scss:style.css

```
this will copy everything what's happens in scss file into css file, and then be presented on the page (I couldn't not find better way to work with scss and html together without React or other extra frameworks).
